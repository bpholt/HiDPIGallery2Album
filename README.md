HiDPIGallery2Album
==================
This utility loads the images from a Gallery2 album and outputs the HTML needed to embed the images as HiDPI images.

Clone the repository on your Gallery2 server, load the HTML page, and enter the album ID. (The utility needs to run on the same server as your Gallery2 instance to avoid cross-origin issues. Alternatively, ensure the Gallery2 API includes the necessary CORS headers.)
